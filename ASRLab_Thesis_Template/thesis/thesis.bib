abstract="We present a (probabilistic) public key encryption (PKE) scheme such that when being implemented in a bilinear group, anyone is able to check whether two ciphertexts are encryptions of the same message. Interestingly, bilinear map operations are not required in key generation, encryption or decryption procedures of the PKE scheme, but is only required when people want to do an equality test (on the encrypted messages) between two ciphertexts that may be generated using different public keys. We show that our PKE scheme can be used in different applications such as searchable encryption and partitioning encrypted data. Moreover, we show that when being implemented in a non-bilinear group, the security of our PKE scheme can be strengthened from One-Way CCA to a weak form of IND-CCA.",
