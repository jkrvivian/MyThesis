The publish-subscribe messaging model is widely used in IoT applications for exchanging data between devices due to its scalability and resource-effieciency. In the publish-subscribe system, a broker is the bridge to meet publishers and subscribers. Broker is a centralized group that arrange the communication between the publishers and subscribers. However, the centralized architecture brings potential vulnerabilities and security issues:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Central point of failure. 
	The broker is usually held by a single organization. If the centralized server is crashed or attacked, the services will not be available. 	
	\item Data integrity.
	As broker controls the interaction between publishers and subscribers, an unreliable or compromised broker can easily tamper data streams. 
	\item Anonymity and privacy.
	Broker matches publishers and subscribers in order to relay data streams to corresponding entities. The unreliable broker can expose the subscribers' interests and personal information of both entities.
